# Question: 0
hello team,
This is regarding Create Form Task. Please let me know if it's not the correct channel :keanu-thanks:

I have a partner who sends a dynamic source for a Drop-Down List in the Create Form Task -&gt; Open Form Designer
• Example of Values:
    ◦ A
    ◦ B
    ◦ C
They also send a prepopulated value that comes from AI (which we all know, could hallucinate), so they send the prepopulated following Value:
    ◦ D
When selecting the values, D also comes up as a "valid" value, even though it should not.

my suggestion to them was to do pre-processing, to make sure that the values are mapped correctly, however, the pertinent scenario of transmiting the following information to the user: "PLEASE REVIEW - AI recommends D", is also valid.

is there any way we can have the "required" for the form to only enable the values of the source data?

cc: <@WLXP0272L>
** Probable Answers: **
1. Could you please Share me a sample Workflow to replicate this issue.
2. I think we found a solution using Javascript. We changed the dropdown argument to an in/out and we were able to access it in the Javascript logic to do the validation there

# Question: 1
Hi Team!

My customer Cigna is getting the following error: "*<http://cloud.uipath.com|cloud.uipath.com>* refused to connect". When they are trying to see with preview of documents through action center that are loaded into a uipath hosted storage bucket.

They create the following case in Salesforce: 02409570
<https://uipath.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Pa00000CXlCXIA1/view>

But I would like to know if you have any idea what may be happening, and what I should review tomorrow in the meeting with them?

Thank you in advance for your help!
** Probable Answers: **
1. <@W0173AXGRP1> is looking into this issue <@U05RK0X363A>
2. <@U05RK0X363A> Can you share me the workflow which i could use to reproduce this issue? The HAR file reflects no issue.
Could you share me a video recording for the issue as well ?
3. <@W0173AXGRP1> Hi team! Thank you for your quick reply, I will connect with the team at 10 am CT, so I will request the code and record the error.
Would you like to join the meeting with me to validate the topic?

# Question: 2
:alert: team, is the actions service down on staging?
** Probable Answers: **
1. cc: <@W0173AXGRP1>
FYI - staging is working for me
2. I tried incognito etc... :thinking_face:
3. Can you check if the service is enabled from Admin?
4. the services are enabled, looks like orchestrator doesn't work as well, so it might be a bigger problem
5. Yeah, if the API calls to Orchestrator are failing then Action Center would not work as we have dependency on Orchestrator

# Question: 3
Hi Team!

What is the difference between Reassigned and Forwarded?

After reading the documentation I have only found that Reassign can only be used by the admin, but Forward can be used by admin or normal users. But I don't see any difference at the process level.

Thanks,
** Probable Answers: **
1. &gt; But I don't see any difference at the process level.
You are right, no difference at the process level

hi team,
customer *<https://uipath.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Account/0011Q00002ASvgVQAT/view|Office of Public Works>* has a question regarding the tasks in Action Center.

Scenario:
A task is created and user A will assign himself., they are not using action catalogs.
Classify the task
Now the action is getting unassigned

Is this an expected behavior ? A task to be unassigned after classify?

Thank you!

# Question: 5
hello team, it seems not possible to see if a task has comments unless the user open the comments section. What if we add a little icon in the task list when an item has comments? (good idea from <@U05HGFEJP2Q>)
** Probable Answers: **
1. I agree with this idea. During the demo this morning, I couldn't even find back the task where I originally had added the comment.
2. I've also noticed that the "properties" section has a "Comments" textbox where if you add a comment you see it in the Comments section...not sure if this may be confusing for an end user

# Question: 8
Hello team,

Do you see fit a refresh button in the main Action Center  dashboard? I noticed that the various indicators continue to show the old data until a manual browser refresh. As in other Cloud screens / products, a refresh button could do the job. Seeing the button on the page would also suggest to the user that the data might not be accurate unless refreshed. Another solution could be an automatic refresh after each action taken on an task.

# Question: 9
Hi Team,

About the following new improvement: "Each tenant now receives an email digest, grouped by services. The digest includes the tenant's name. Emails feature a unique sender ID and name, personalized to each tenant."

• The Cigna client is asking me for more documentation about this improvement, do you know where I can find it?
• Also they asked: For all emails, we have the option to turn on or off, but for *Each tenant now receives an email digest, grouped by services*. Is it still the same or where we could control this? e.g. if we don’t want it to turn on for some tenant. What steps are needed here.
I checked the new academy courses and the latest release notes, but there is no additional information either
<https://docs.uipath.com/action-center/automation-cloud/latest/user-guide/release-notes-may-2024>
** Probable Answers: **
1. <@WNX660CV9> is checking this and will be getting back to you by EOD
2. The documentation might not be correct as digest feature is enabled only for orchestrator service. I will check further with <@U05MV2GMCF8> 
Cc <@U03E3EYC7QD> <@U02L25A27RD> 
3. Thank you, <@U05RK0X363A>, <@U03QQFRBFUN>, <@WNX660CV9>. I'm checking this with <@U036HL477AQ> and get back with an answer.
4. Hi, everyone! The documentation for the email digest is in the last step from this <https://docs.uipath.com/automation-cloud/automation-cloud/latest/admin-guide/managing-notifications#customizing-email-notifications-for-your-organization|section>. Indeed, it is not specified that’s available only for Orchestrator. This was a problem from when we initially documented it. <@U05MV2GMCF8> would you be kind and mention this in the docs, pls? 

<@WNX660CV9> pls let us know if we should mention anything else.

Thank you for your understanding, and we’ll make sure to fix this gap in our notification service process.
5. Thank you so much, <@U036HL477AQ>
6. @Serban Diana created a Bug DOC-13563 Specify that the digest feature is only enabled for Orchestrator
7. &gt;  Indeed, it is not specified that’s available only for Orchestrator.
Let me double check on this with <@U02L25A27RD> and <@W011N9D12SJ>
8. At present digest feature is enabled only for Orchestrator events. Orchestrator onboarding to notification is being verified in staging at the moment. cc: <@U03E3EYC7QD>
9. i don't think this is a documentation only issue. this needs to change in the product as well. we cannot have digest option on the email config page, if it applies to Orchestrator only.

# Question: 13
Hi Team.

Are there any known limitations on AC dropdowns?

Length and number of values?
Per Dropdown or across multiple dropdowns on 1 screen?
** Probable Answers: **
1. I don't think there is a hard limit on the no: of dropdowns, but we would soon have a 1MB limit on the overall form data.

That said, if we have too many dropdown values, it would impact the form performance.

Hello Team,

Currently, the data grid of the form
When the 'AddAnother' button is pressed, it is recognised that a row is added at the bottom.
A customer has asked whether it is possible to have a new row inserted at the intended position.

Is it correct that this is not possible as the user cannot adjust the datagrid in the specification?
** Probable Answers: **
1. A new row is inserted as the last row of the grid. However, if `Allow Reorder`  is checked in the form design, the user can reorder the datagrid rows

Hi Team,

Do we plan to release any specific RBAC or rights segregation for Action Center? I am specifically interested in the action catalogues.

Hi, I have a customer who keeps getting timed out of action center which has caused them to pause their entire production environment. It takes their employees 2+ hours to complete classification tasks in action center and if they leave to take a break, their session is timed out by the time they get back and all their work is gone. Is there is a way to extend session lengths in action center or intermittently save progress made in tasks without submitting?

# Question: 19
Hi Team!

JNJ customer is working on its first implementation with Action Center, and they want to validate the best practices for deploying Action Center catalogs between environments, Do we have any best practice guides for this? Is there a way to import and export the catalogs?

I am doing a test using Solution Management and the catalogs do not appear (Images 1 and 2), but in the documentation it says that it is supported.

<@WLXNUE3LY>
** Probable Answers: **
1. I am checking this
2. Btw, are you able to other resources in that folder?
3. You were right, the problem was permissions, apparently being the "Folder Administrator" is not enough, the "Administrator" role in the folder is necessary. Adding this role worked correctly.

This makes sense? What is the necessary permission to view the elements?

Thank you!
4. <https://docs.uipath.com/solutions-management/automation-cloud/latest/user-guide/prerequisites> - The required roles for solution management are tenant-level roles. Hence Folder Administrator is not enough.

Hi Team,

Request your help on the below <https://uipath.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/5005b00002A9qPvAAJ/view|customer issue>.

*Issue*: For a few users, intermittently *format* gets changed(from English to weird symbols) for a couple of *invoices* in the action center.

*Description*:
•  The customer found the invoice with data extracted in *English*, but the action center changed the formatting completely in the display.
• the same invoice appears fine in plain English when they open the invoice in the Action Center or even when the same user logs in to the Action Center from their PC.
•  *Some* of their client users have experienced this issue and reported it to the customer internally. But if customer searches the same document in the Action Center, it looks good. 
*Attachments*:
Video, HAR file

• _During the whole video, the user has shown different examples of documents with special/weird characters appearing in the Action Center for their clients._
•  _00:00:32 --– user loads one of the invoices with special characters_
• _until 00:01:29 ---collecting Har_  
• _until 00:04:59 ---then the user shows some other examples of invoices with special characters and trying various things (refreshing browser, restarting UiPath session, trying a different browser, etc.)_

8. Lets try and follow the formal escalation procedure for these. Open an ER and the MCS can raise a jira. The dev team is not accountable for anything and if this did turn out to be a bug, any delays would be on support at this point.

On  the other hand, if we follow the escalation procedure there is accountablility

10. sure..thanks all!
11. <@W014NNZMPQ8> investigated a bit this issue but we are unable to reproduce it.

<@U0276RKSD8D> We believe that it's an issue with some fonts used in those documents (Helvetica font) that are missing on the machines used by the client. Anyway, we've created <https://uipath.atlassian.net/browse/ACTV-71514?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNzkyODBmZjdmYTdiNGVlZmE3Y2Q2YzdlZjhjODdiNDUiLCJwIjoiamlyYS1zbGFjay1pbnQifQ|an issue> in our sprint and we'll try to find ways to reproduce it and fix it. In the meantime would be really helpful if you could ask the client the following questions:
1. what environment are they running on (OS version, browser version)
2. do they have the Helvetica font installed on those machines?
3. what fonts are used in the documents that have this kind of issue?
4. can they please send the browser's console logs as well
12. Hi ..below is the pdf in which customer's client is facing the issue.

Also customer confirmed as below,

_When I view the same document, it appears to be fine on my PC._
_Should this be related to license (or type of user role), as I could never see a document like this and I have admin access._
13. ok, so the issue is not intermitent. The problem is that these documents use the `Helvetica`  font which seems to be missing from the Windows computers, but they are available on most of the Apple computers. The workaround would be to install the Helvetica font on that machine, but be aware that it's not a free font, needs to be bought. The other workaround would be to transform that document from PDF into an image (PNG, JPG) and use the image instead, but I'm not sure if they can do that.

In the meantime we'll fix the issue on our end, but it will take about 1 month to reach the prod, because we depend on the . Would that be ok for the customer?
14. @Sergiu Bologa created a Bug ACTV-71565 [FE][PDFViewer] PDF documents using Helvetica font don't open correctly in PDF viewer
15. thanks..let me check with the customer
16. customer is asking as below,

_Although, I am still looking for an answer on how it is an issue all of sudden, when we have been sending /submitting invoices in Action center for past 14 + months for the same suppliers without any issues. E.g. whether there were any changes/released in the Action Center program from your end or changes from our end, or something else??_
17. Good question, but I don't know. We haven't made any changes recently so I suspect that their documents started to use the Helvetica font only recently. Can they check this maybe? This would help if we can confirm.

Anyway, we'll try to reproduce the issue before fixing it so we're sure we've fixed it.
18. Are the users on the same machines where it has worked for the past 14 months? did the customer mention if on the same machine, a very similar document worked before and it does not work now?
19. Its same user with same machine and same documents were working fine
20. what do you mean same documents? Are they processing exactly the same documents?
21. I mean same font documents
22. Could you please get one working and one non working document ? So we could compare? Or plan for a call sometime next week IST time?
23. sure..ill ask for their slots
24. but only if they can provide a user who has this issue on their machine and they can share their screen
25. okay
26. Hi <@W014NNZMPQ8>, the customer confirmed that the User is available anytime other than Tuesday (tomorrow) ACST (UTC + 9:30). Please let me know your availability.
27. I think you wanted to ask <@WLRCUUUTT>. Please invite me and <@WLRCUUUTT>. For me it's fine that time

Is there a plan to document this issue as a known limitation? I am wondering if you are having trouble with errors, including other users.

# Question: 26
hello team, I have a partner who raised awareness that client _*Stromnetz Hamburg*_ encountered a problem:

they are asking if there is a way to deactivate the display.
** Probable Answers: **
1. <@WLX9A3Q04> You can customize the *All Users* table, by removing columns from the table. Click dropdown icon next to  *Columns* as shown in the snap below and deselect the column you wish to remove.
2. is there a way for this to persist or will it return to default showing at every refresh?
3. Yea, seems like it won't persist after the refresh. <@U03E3EYC7QD> Could you please look into this....seems like customize column option goes back to default view once refreshed or is it an intended design?
4. <@WLX9A3Q04> I did a check. right now, the inbuilt capability is as such that it will return default after refresh. We will have a look into it and try to bring in the capability where we can have these customized views.

1. Hi <@U0363F28KNE>, Good Afternoon. May I know in which environment are you facing this issue? Also, can you please provide us with the HAR file and check if you can see some issues in console and please provide us with that? Thanks!
2. I am using the uipathlabs and Playground tenant. HAR file attached
3. Any luck <@U03DA6HLSCA>...
4. Please find the console log attached for your reference.
5. Hey <@U03DA6HLSCA>. Is there any update as I have a client demo tomorrow morning?
6. We don't see anything in HAR file, although we see quite a lot of errors in the console. Please attach the HAR file for when the task is loaded. Apart from that, is this an App Task or a Form Task?

Hi folks, can you change a `Pending` task to `Unassigned` via Studio Workflow? For instance if a task has been pending for N time, move it back to `Unassigned` cc: <@U06G4TE7MJ7> <@WLMUX4KAN>
** Probable Answers: **
1. <@U057BU0KUTS> If I understand your question right, do you need an activity for AC in studio which enables the "Pending" task to "Unassigned" automatically for certain period of time it rested in pending action stage?                                                   We can still do the same in AC page: To change the pending tasks to unassigned state/To unassign Actions make sure you are in the manage actions view. On the Pending tab, click the More options menu for the desired Action. Select Unassign to remove the Action from the current user assignment.                          CC <@U03E3EYC7QD>
2. I believe this can be done today with the Tasks endpoints in the Orchestrator API 
3. hey Nathan, we're building an activity called `Configure Task Timer` that you can use to set an SLA timer on a task and an outcome on timer expiry. the outcomes supported today are `Alert user` and `Reassign`. we can explore adding an `Unassign` outcome to it (<@WNX660CV9>).

this is in alpha now, and should be in prod in a few weeks.
4. NICE! This is great <@U03E3EYC7QD>. Exactly what the customer is looking for.
5. Hi <@U03E3EYC7QD> Do you have any firm timelines for this rollout as my client is also looking for this feature for certain use cases. Thanks!

# Question: 33
Hi team,

A customer has an issue with the drop-down menus in Action Center Cloud, since last week, they only see a single entry and the search does not work properly (see screenshot below)

Checking on my side, I also see a similar behavior on both Cloud and Staging.

Is this a known issue? I could not find a Jira ticket for it.

Thank you
** Probable Answers: **
1. Update to this:

 I was able to reproduce this using:

1. Tab
    a. Data Grid
        i. Dropdown
And selecting the Dropdown Widget Type as "ChoiceJS" instead of HTML5 (see the screenshots below)

Is this known? Customer states it's only been happening for about a week.
2. Hi team, can you please take a look at this?

A similar issue happens when using HTML instead, where the search does not return results when there are many items, is this a known behavior?
3. <@U03DA6HLSCA> is this related to Angular 17 upgrade?
4. Hi <@U03QQFRBFUN>, this seems like an issue with Forms.

<@W011TETMQ84> Can you share a sample standalone Form Task Activity with mock data?

CC: <@U03MPBFHHEG>
5. sure, please see this:

First dropdown uses HTML5, which is okay but does not have a search
Second dropdown uses ChoiceJS, which has search but somehow expands inside the iframe.

Screenshots are taken from Assistant, but same happens in a browser
6. <@U03DA6HLSCA> <@U03QQFRBFUN> <@U03MPBFHHEG>

Hello Team, I have a customer who had an UI Issue with Action Center.

1. As seen in the first screenshot, the "Freight Rate", it was squeezed and unable to fill in any data.
2. As shown in the second screenshot, the "Freight Rate" was looking good and will be able to enter data. But the actual document was missing and table 2 is outside of the box.

This issue started happening from past 1 week. No Code was changed.

Attaching a video for reference. You can start watching at 00::37 to 1:50 you will be able to understand the issue

*Description*:

1. Customer is using form activity to send form task to Action Center.
2. It consists of number of rows.
3. If we delete 1 row and then edit the row item then it will _*not allow us to save or cancel ---->*_If we click on edit button of 1st row, then instead of opening 1st row it is opening 2 rows and then proceeding further it is not able to do any further steps like click on Save button or Cancel button.

4. this looks to be a Forms bug. <@U03QQFRBFUN> to assign and investigate
5. Thanks <@U03E3EYC7QD>!
6. Hi <@U0276RKSD8D> Can you share the workflow with us?
7. cc: <@U04RSTNB4PM>
8. Unfortunately, customer is not willing to share the actual workflow.
We only have form template and sample workflows
9. Will check with the Sample workflow itself. Will reach out once I have some updates.
10. Hi <@U0276RKSD8D> <@U04RSTNB4PM> I am able to replicate the issue on my local. We might have figured out what the issue is but will need to check on the root cause of this. This might be due to the failure of validation on the mandatory `Item Category` field. We have `Redraw On` option that's attached to the Item Edit Grid. The purpose of this option is: `Redraw this component if another component changes. This is useful if interpolating parts of the component like the label.` I think when we delete a row, it redraws the components and when we change any value, it empties the dropdown and no options can be seen. Since it's empty, it fails the validation and `Save` or `Cancel` doesn't work.

If we remove the `Redraw On` option, the issue does gets resolved. As a workaround, depending on the business use case, please test and have a conversation with the customer if we can remove that option as shown in attached screenshot.

Meanwhile, we will discuss this internally with the team and figure the root cause of this issue or if there's a better solution to this.
11. Hi <@U04RSTNB4PM> <@U0276RKSD8D>, just to add to the previous conversation, I consulted with the team, the `Redraw On` option is not a good choice as it has some performance implications. Apart from that, since it's `Any Change` and specified at the grid level, changes in nearby areas might affect it's components which again is not a good choice. I would suggest using Logic and Events depending on the business implications as it's more performant and a stabler approach.

That being said, the issue with the dropdown as mentioned above seems to be an issue with the  <http://Form.io|Form.io> team. Will check with them if it's a bug or an expected behavior.

CC: <@U03QQFRBFUN>
12. Thanks <@U03DA6HLSCA> for the update.
Please keep us updated whether it's a bug or an expected behavior.
13. Will do, however, please suggest the changes to the `Redraw On` option to the customer as well.
14. That should be a viable workaround depending on the business use case till a final solution is found.

# Question: 39
Hi Team,
We have an issue with getting the sum of values from the form table (counting Amount values which are Currency fields). In the Preview, the values are displayed correctly, but in the Action Center, the value is not changing and in the Console, we see an error.
The project is built in Studio 23.10.6.
Can you please provide a working sample based on the customer's template for the total field (Currency)? Or if the issue is not from the Javascript code, can you fix that in Action Center?

We posted earlier on <https://uipath-product.slack.com/archives/CN9ADUMC7/p1714091812556629> and we were redirected here as the issue may be in the Action Center itself.

FYI: <@U057LMG32R4>
** Probable Answers: **
1. This is the logic for the Total field:

If one particular checkbox (out_IsException) is true

To provide the below value in the Total field:

```let amountTotal = 0;
    let lineCount = data.io_DataTable.length;
    for (let i=0; i&lt;lineCount; i++) {
        amountTotal = (+amountTotal) + (+data.io_DataTable[i].Amount);
    }
return amountTotal;```

2. I think I figure it out.

<@U057LMG32R4> ask the customer to not use *let* keywords as it is not recognized in Action Center.

So ask to try with this code:

```amountTotal = 0;
lineCount = data.io_DataTable.length;
    for (i=0; i<lineCount; i++) {
        amountTotal = (+amountTotal) + (+data.io_DataTable[i].Amount);
    }
return amountTotal;```
3. Example:
4. thanks Marian :slightly_smiling_face:
5. <@U03E3EYC7QD> can we add this limitation noted somewhere in the action center documentation? I think not only the *let* javascript reserved keyword is not recognized but others also.
6. yes' we'll update the docs. <@U06KMV4RG1M> <@U05MV2GMCF8>
7. <@U02FU623Y0M>, <@U03E3EYC7QD>, thank you. I will add a ticket and update the documentation.

# Question: 40
Hello team,
Is there a way to have draggable rows in a Data/Edit Grid? Or to sort the grid based on a column? In desktop Forms, we have a component called <https://docs.uipath.com/activities/other/latest/workflow/using-the-data-map-component|DataTable> which enables this functionality, along with some others, but it is not available in the Action Center Form Builder. Seems like a weird thing since there seems to be 1:1 feature parity between the two builders EXCEPT the DataTable component.
Also, using a .uiform file does not seem to work with the Create Form Task activity. Any guidance here?
** Probable Answers: **
1. After a bit of digging, I found out we are using the same form builder both for desktop Forms as well as for Action Center, which is <http://form.io|form.io>. However premium components like the DataTable are not enabled in Action Center. Why is this the case and can it be enabled on demand?

Hi team,
What are the permissions required to see the Action Apps admin settings?
*Action Center &gt; Tenant &gt; Admin Settings &gt; Action Apps*
:thank-you:
** Probable Answers: **
1. Cc: <@U03MPBFHHEG>
2. Hi <@WLLBMQPHR>, `ActionDesign.View` is required
3. Hi <@U03MPBFHHEG>, I suppose this is an Orchestrator permission, correct?
I cannot find that `ActionDesign` permission set in any of the role types (tenant or folder).
What am I missing?
4. <@WLLBMQPHR> Yes it is orchestrator permission and it is present in  `Allow to be Automation User` , `administrator`  and `Allow to be Folder Administrator` . You can use any of the above existing role.
5. The screenshots above are the from the `Administrator` role, and I don't see anything resembling `ActionDesign`. Does it have a different display name?
6. I have a customer with the same issue. They say they are logged in as administrator (will verify later in a remote session with them), but when they want to go to the Action Apps tab they get the message they don not have the permissions to view this page.
7. Thanks <@U04LFJJE7FG>
I thought it's a lack of proper permissions issue, but you just confirmed this is not an isolated case. I guess I'll have to ask my customer to open an incident ticket.
8. Check if you are adding the Allow to be Automation User and automation user (in at least one folder) for your user in all the tenants -> Sign out and sign in again
9. Thanks <@U02FU623Y0M> for your response
But I have a couple of clarifications:
1. The user having this problem is Administrator.
2. This seems to be a Tenant level feature (*Action Center &gt; `Tenant` &gt; Admin Settings &gt; Action Apps*), why do they have to be "`automation user (in at least one folder)`"?
:thank-you:
10. Because the actions view permission

Try to add and see if that helped
11. When you are opening Actions, this endpoint is called
12. <@WLLBMQPHR> and I met with the customer today and tried the suggestions above, but the issue persists. We added all the roles available to be added, except Robot, and the issue still occurs. We also added Folder Administrator and Automation User role onto Administrator on a Folder in the tenant, and it still occurred.

Issue is happening on my pro trial tenant: <https://cloud.uipath.com/bpiret/DefaultTenant/>
I added all permissions that could be possibly added at Tenant and Folder level and it still occurs. (see images)

Created a brand new org <https://cloud.uipath.com/penterprises/DefaultTenant/> and it doesn't occur.  These are the roles default out-of-the-box: User Tenant Roles are Orchestrator Administrator, Solutions Administrator, and Allow to be Automation Developer. Folder Roles: Folder Administrator &amp; Automation Developer.
13. <@U04LFJJE7FG> who is your customer who is seeing the same behavior?
14. Hi Brian,
It's actually a partner developing something for one of their customers.
Partner is CGI in Germany, and the ID for the tenant they see the issue with is  : *9859-3023-3803-8981*
15. Hi <@U027J0JL4CU>, has the customer renamed the organisation name?
CC: <@W0173AXGRP1>
16. If yes, there is workaround going on to support the organisation name change. Will update one the fix for that is merged.

> In December 2022 we changed our Organization URL from "`sherwntpamqr`" to "`sherwinwilliams`". We are noticing now that the Ahub Url value in our Insights report is still using the old organization URL of "sherwntpamqr". This is a request to see how we can change the Insights Ahub URL to use the new url with "sherwinwilliams". See example report attached.
19. <@U03MPBFHHEG> looks like the org is in the process of being downgraded to Community. I just reproduced the issue in the bpiret org this morning; not sure if downgrading the org will have any impact or not...
20. I will check after login to your org. 
Just for info: The changes are merged but it will take atleast 2 weeks to be deployed in the cloud regions.
Cc: <@W0173AXGRP1> 
21. Is there a process available to deploy the changes sooner? We'll need to be able to explain to the customer why it will take at least two weeks, and why we can't provide a known availability date.
22. Cc: <@U03QQFRBFUN> 
23. <@U027J0JL4CU> We were fast enough to identify the fix. The releases take 2 weeks of time. If we had fixed the issue by next week it would have taken 4 weeks of time. The Release Cycle is 2 every two weeks. This is what you should communicate to the Customer.
24. Thanks for the details and the quick turnaround <@W0173AXGRP1>. It helps to know this context in these discussions.
25. We are happy to help. Thanks for reaching us out and including all the details. It helped us debug faster and fix it :blush:

# Question: 48
Hi team,

A cloud client asked me :

"How many concurrent jobs can be put into wait for user action status"

I could not find that information in the docs.

The main concern here is : Let's say there's a limit of 100 jobs that can be suspended while waiting for a user action. What happens when the 101th job will need to be suspended ?

Thank you in advance :pray:
** Probable Answers: **
1. I don't think there is any such limit. But please check in <#CMBFRH7HA|help-orchestrator>

# Question: 50
I have a client saying they were using automation express license to access action center before and it apprently stop to work. Was this possible ? <@U04Q7F6SSET>
** Probable Answers: **
1. Automation Express doesn't by itself grant access to Action Center. they would need Named User Licenses, <@WLXNPLZR6> to keep me honest
2. We collected some more info. They have some older users using the Action Center normally even it is showing the message that it is missing licenses for it, and new users can't see anything there even after they gave them some Developer licenses (both have the same rights in folders). They don't have any attended or action center licenses in their contract.

Hello Team,

I need a help from Action Center expert.

Customer is using standalone action center and the issue started after changing the ip address to private.
Issue: - Customer is unable to access Action Center

They had the issue of Orchestrator and Action Center are down.
Issue is resolved for Orchestrator but unable for Action Center.

Validated that all the required roles and permissions are provided to the users but still issue persist.
Accepted Root URL’s. is already configuration for them.
Index.html is in the default documents section.

Is there anything else I need to validate?
** Probable Answers: **
1. cc: - <@U01T2FHTFHU> <@U02F0TWTES1>
2. <@WLXPBCD0V> to help look into
3. from HAR and the image file, it looks like AC is not able to access the backend service. To start debugging,could you please provide more information:
1 . Try accessing <https://uipath-actioncenter-npd-mel-cww.azurewebsites.net/actioncenterservice> in the browser. Let us know the outcome.
2. How did you resolve for the orchestrator issue? Are IP addresses of Orchestrator and AC still private?
3. In UiPath.Orchestrator.dll.Config, I could not see an entry for Accepted Root Url. Could you please point me to the same
Cc: <@W0173AXGRP1>
4. 1. Will ask from customer to validate the URL.
2. Restarting of the services has resolved Orchestrator issue. Yes, they are private
3. Please see below screenshot for Accepted Root URL
5. Please uninstall and reinstall Action Center with the hostnames for actioncenter/orchestrator/identity.
6. I believe this is PaaS installation. Just re-run the AC installation script with the correct values. it should start working again.

# Question: 53
Hi team, did this morning's incident also impact US organizations? A customer reported they couldn't access the Action Center around the same time and sent the attached error.

1. There were 2 incidents in morning
• <#C06UYKPUCFJ|>: It didn't had an impact in US
• <#C06UA7M9H2N|>: Issue on the Orchestrator deployment, which was resolved quickly. This might had that impact, as we can see SLA drops in US as well.

# Question: 54
Hi team,

A customer (Metsä Group) is using Action Center for validation purposes in DU workflows. They mentioned that they are facing some difficulties with the layout of the validation station where the users are not always able to fit everything on the screen. They have compiled some of their observations in a document which I'm sharing below.

Their CoE also said that they are concerned about this affecting the user adoption of action center + DU, i.e. users deciding not to use tools that are provided by the CoE. I said that we always appreciate direct feedback from customers and I think Metsä would also appreciate an indication that their feedback has been registered on the product level.

If possible, I think they would greatly appreciate a feedback session of some sort with the product team. Would this sort of session be possible?

Thank you in advance!
** Probable Answers: **
1. <@WLRCUUUTT> FYI feedback on validation station UI.
2. on the roadmap for 24.10
3. <@U04TDDB6KK6> feel free to set up a call with them and include me, I’d like to capture more feedback if they want to share more.
4. Hi <@WLRCUUUTT>, thank you very much. I'll synch with the customer to try find a suitable time and set this up.

# Question: 56
Hi Team!

My client has the following question:
On Action Center, the Reassign dropdown shows everybody with access to UiPath (in all tenants). Is there a way to limit the choices to those with Action Center global group specific to the AC catalog?

What’s good: only users that have AC group for specific Action Catalog can access the tasks on Action Center.
For example, I have G_UIPATH_AC_OIAOnboarding1427_RLSE which can access to 1472_Onboarding action catalog

What’s bad: If I try to Reassign action to somebody else -> Reassign button shows all users (prod and nonprod). See screenshot below. So, if I mistakenly assign it to a user who does not have AC permission, the Action task will remain pending forever. Is there a way to limit the available choices on the Reassign dropdown so that it will only show users with the AC gg for the Action Catalog?

Thank you for your help team!
** Probable Answers: **
1. <@W0173AXGRP1> do we not validate the list of users? is this something that will be fixed with People picker?
2. Hi Team, do you have an estimated date for this enhancement?

# Question: 57
Hello team,

Is it possible to use cloud Action Center from a on-premise environment? Something like this:
** Probable Answers: **
1. cc: <@U02U4R6QSP2>
2. <@WLXPBCD0V> could you review this?
3. Hi <@U06FHBRSBAQ> - As I can see the scenario, Orchestrator is on prem and Action Center is on Cloud. This scenario is not supported. Action Center on Cloud by default connects with Orchestrator on Cloud. It can not be configured to connect to on prem Orchestrator.
One question - When the customer has Action Center on Cloud, why don't they use Orchestrator on Cloud only?
4. Also, Onpremises environment means Automation Suite? If yes, then Action Center is also available in Automation Suite. Why we are not using Action Center from Automation Suite?
5. <@WLXPBCD0V> <@U03E3EYC7QD> for this customer, they are currently on a Standalone environment and want to embed Action Center into Salesforce.

• Do they need to migrate to Automation Cloud to do this? (our understanding is currently this requires Cloud)
• Are there any plans to make available the functionality to embed Action Center into a web application for on-prem customers in our next release (or future state)? Or is this technically not possible? 
This use case embedding Action Center into Salesforce could be the business driver for this customer to upgrade to our Flex licensing and migrate to Cloud, so appreciate your guidance.

<@U02U4R6QSP2> <@U06FHBRSBAQ> <@U05QD8LN28L>
6. <@U03E3EYC7QD> Checking back on the above - are there any plans in our roadmap for Action Center to make it possible for on-prem customers (standalone environment) to embed Action Center into Salesforce? (web applications)
7. Or is this not technically feasible?
8. there seem to be multiple questions between two threads here, trying to summarize here
1. support for standalone on-prem Orchestrator working with Action Center cloud
    a. <@WLXPBCD0V> keep me honest - from the response above, this config is not fundamentally supported (regardless of embed options)
2. support for embed with Cloud Action Center (POC)
    a. <@WLXPBCD0V> i think you mentioned we can embed just the task without the left nav, etc. how can the customer enable that? 
<@U05AMKHHP16> <@U02U4R6QSP2> we've been discussing to improve the Action Center embedding experience overall in the medium term roadmap, so we can pick up these enhancements even if we don't support them today.
9. for 1, <@WLXPBCD0V>,
• the customer is on msi, not automation suite. <@U02U4R6QSP2> <@U06FHBRSBAQ> - can one of you confirm this?
• we already let them know that the onprem orchestrator - action center cloud config is not supported. The ask is to see if they can embed their onprem action center into salesforce instead of having to go action center in the cloud for embedding. 
10. Yes, <@U05QD8LN28L>. They are on msi.
11. <@U03E3EYC7QD> Kalyani summarized it best - would you please confirm if they can embed their on prem action center into salesforce, instead of having to go action center in the cloud for embedding (or if there are any plans to make this possible)?
12. AC would be dependent on embed support from the on-prem team, which <@WLX9D421J> mentioned is not in the plans.

&gt; from <@U02U4R6QSP2> they are doing POC in cloud. We set up a trial. The question is if there is a way to only iFrame the tasks portal. It shows the whole cloud instance currently in iFrame.
this is something we can look into, and support
13. Thanks <@U03E3EYC7QD>. For Action Center embedding experience improvements, are we able to share a timeframe with the customer?

# Question: 58
Hello team! I have a customer who is embedding their 23.4 action center into an iFrame. They are following these docs: <https://docs.uipath.com/action-center/standalone/2023.4/user-guide/embedding-actions> . However the URL in the docs looks like it is meant for cloud:
```https://{yourDomain}/embed_/myorganization/DefaultTenant/actions_```
however the customer's action center URL does not include organization or Default tenant: <https://ause1rpasche02.ds.mot.com:444/actions> . How should the embedding URL work in this case?
cc: <@U06FHBRSBAQ>
** Probable Answers: **
1. Hi <@U02U4R6QSP2> unfortunately Standalone doesn't support embedding. This is a cloud/AS only feature.

<@U036HL477AQ> <@U05MV2GMCF8> can we please remove embedding from Standalone section?

cc <@U03QQFRBFUN> <@WLXPBCD0V> <@WLZK1TW4F>
2. Thank you very much, <@W0173AXGRP1>. I will create a ticket for it.
3. @Serban Diana created a Task DOC-12313 Remove embedding from Standalone section
4. cc: <@U029J8QAMBR>
5. Hey <@W0173AXGRP1>, it looks like someone informed a premium customer that this was possible (due to the incorrect documentation) and they are now frustrated since they upgraded to handle this. Is there any workaround for them outside of using AS or cloud to embed?
6. This client intend to automate many processes using Action Center embedded on Salesforce. They have upgraded their environment based on our documentation, we are trying to find a workaround on this. Any ideas are more than welcome.

cc: <@U05AMKHHP16>, <@WLZK13GF9>
7. Hello <@W0173AXGRP1>, the customer completed the PoC, however they are asking if there is a way to only iFrame the tasks portal. Right now they can view the entire cloud portal. See screenshot:
8. You have to check with <@WLX9D421J>. As per my last disucssion with him we don't support on-prem MSI for embed.
9. <@WLX9D421J> - they are doing POC in cloud. We set up a trial. The question is if there is a way to only iFrame the tasks portal. It shows the whole cloud instance currently in iFrame.
10. <@WLX9D421J> Could you please confirm if there are any plans for us to support embedding Action Center using an on-prem license to Salesforce (web based application)? Or in order for the functionality to work, do we need to have Action Center on-cloud?
11. in on-prem embedding is currently unsupported and I don’t think theres any plan on the road map for it currently, so it would have to be on cloud
12. for the question on only showing the tasks portal - thats a question for the action center team since they control what renders at that route

# Question: 59
Hi, team! I have a customer who can't see the AC tasks after submission. He is getting the error attached.
Is this by design with the UiPath.DocumentUnderstanding.Activities package? Because he is not using UiPath.IntelligentOCR.Activities and the UiPath.DocumentUnderstanding.ML.Activities, although this is a Windows project.
** Probable Answers: **
1. do they have the right permissions for accessing Storage buckets in Orchestrator?
2. is there any error in the console? Can you please send a HAR file?
3. in UiPath.DocumentUnderstanding.Activities, the files pertaining to a task are automatically deleted when the task is resumed.

# Question: 60
Hi Team,

A customer is asking for clarification on the Action Center license allocation. According to the documentation available, users require specific licenses to submit tasks from the Action Center. However, as per the customer, they have observed a situation where a business user, who is part of the 'everyone' group, doesn't have any allocated licenses, yet is able to submit tasks without any issue. The only notification the user receives is that they are not allocated the proper license, but it doesn't restrict any of the user's actions in the portal (labeling, submission, assigning to users, etc.). The customer need to understand if this is the expected behavior, as they plan to provision the same set of privileges to production users as well. Appreciate your inputs.
** Probable Answers: **
1. hey Luis, we are not restricting Action Center functionality based on user checks at this point, other than a warning banner that they would need to purchase User licenses. this is the behavior on Prod as well
'''
'''
# Question: 61
HI Team, a customer reached out and said users in the cloud are able to access Action Center even without any license allocated to them. I confirmed the users had Cloud Access but no UiPath licenses (They were automation hub users). Based on licensing the customer (and myself) assumed automation hub users would not have access to Action Center unless they had an Action Center user license. Can someone please advise?

Hello Team.

I'm creating a POC for one of my clients, using embedded Action Center. I created an html to run it locally, but Action Center don't expect to be accessed locally. My workaround on that was to use <https://codepen.io/> to run it, but I wonder if we have proper way or a internal tool to do it.

1. For POC you can use <http://codepen.io|codepen.io> that should be good.

In my testing I have come across a scenario where we run an orchestration process that pulls files in from an input folder for the Document Understanding process, then does a Start Job and Get Reference activity. This is failing with an error of Could not find a machine with Unattended or NonProduction runtimes in the current folder Error code: 2818

Kindly help us if possible. If this is the wrong group. Please redirect us
** Probable Answers: **
1. Found 22.4 or later is resolved for the above bug

2. Unfortunately customer is not willing to upgrade right now, Is there any other way we could accommodate the issue.
3. ^^ <@U03E3EYC7QD> <@U03QQFRBFUN>

Can we check if upgrading to 21.10.X patch in orchestrator can fix this?
4. hey Sharath, could you please check with <#CMBFRH7HA|help-orchestrator>?

# Question: 64
Hi Team,

Is it possible to autosave boxes when selected without clicking the save button, sometimes document SMEs switch to other tasks without saving and data is lost. Also is it possible to hide the unassigned and completed tabs from the business users since they aren't relevant? Perhaps through RBAC?
** Probable Answers: **
1. 1. if you make any changes on a `Document Validation` or `Document Classification` task and you want to move to another task you'll get a confirmation popup that asks you to confirm that the data will be lost.
2. maybe <@U03E3EYC7QD> can answer the RBAC question
2. we have customers with users that self-assign tasks, so its still relevant in some customer's workflows
3. Hi <@U03E3EYC7QD>, I think we can solve for both cases by implementing a role that restricts the view to Pending. For these customers who do self assignment it can remain the same, for customers where they get assigned we can use this role.
4. <@U02EVUK474L> could you please file a JIRA feature request/Product Board Insights? we're looking into role-based visibility throughout AC, and we'll consider this as well.
FYI <@U056RGPEJMB>

# Question: 67
Hi Team,
One of our customer is trying to customize the edit grid using the CSS and they are able to see the changes in the Preview tab where as when the form is created in the action center the CSS added in the template is not getting applied. Also attaching the images for your reference.
The main reason behind applying the CSS, they are having columns more than 6 and due to which the column 7 and 8 are coming to next line and they are trying to customize the same.
We also tried multiple ways but it didn't help. Can you please guide us is there any way we can make this work as we followed the same mentioned in documentation but it didn't help.
CC: <@WLZJP9J15>

4. <@U0221Q1BUH4> <@U01E8U5AKED> Acknowledge it! Will look into and get back.   Adding <@W0173AXGRP1>
5. <@U0221Q1BUH4> I have tried articulation the issue. please find it below:
6. PFA workflow as discussed
7. <@W0173AXGRP1> <@U0221Q1BUH4> The customer is using the create form task. They have used edit grid to display set a data and it is appearing the display window and all columns are appearng the same row (8 columns in this case). but in the action center once the form task is created only 6 columns are appearing in the first and remaining two are apprearing below the first and second column (of the second row).
The customer wants to have all the columns in the first row. for that they tried cutomising the edit grid CSS using the documentation (<https://docs.uipath.com/activities/other/latest/workflow/customizing-edit-grid-templates>). When they added the CSS we can seethe changes in the preview window of the designer. but when task is created in action center the same not getting applied.
8. do we have an in-house repro for the issue?
9. <@U03E3EYC7QD> you can use this workflow to repro the issue at our end
10. <https://uipath-product.slack.com/archives/CN71E6AG1/p1711360632128529?thread_ts=1710844359.341969&amp;cid=CN71E6AG1>
11. <@U06KMV4RG1M> do we have an update on the issue? Customer was looking for a solution.
12. I tried running the workflow and I can reproduce this locally. I'll get in touch with FORMIO team revert back.
13. @Ayushya Jaiswal created a Task ACTN-5894 Formio EditGrid beyond 6+ columns, is jumping to next row
14. Hi <@U0221Q1BUH4>  Please try the following styles as a workaround. Please note there are still some width issues for which we have reached out to <http://Form.io|Form.io> team to resolved but the columns shouldn’t overflow.
```.my-grid {
    overflow: auto;
}

.my-grid .row {
  flex-wrap: nowrap !important;
  width: max-content;
}

.my-grid .col-sm-2 {
    width: 135px;
}```
You might need to tweak the widths to get a pixel perfect alignment. However, for a final fix, we have reached out to the <http://Form.io|Form.io> team for them to resolve this issue.

CC: <@W0173AXGRP1> <@U02L25A27RD> <@U03QQFRBFUN>
15. Thanks <@U03DA6HLSCA> will try and suggest the same to customer
16. Hi <@U0221Q1BUH4> if the above solution doesn't work properly, please try this:
```.my-grid .editgrid-listgroup {
    overflow: auto;
}
.my-grid ul&gt;li.list-group-item {
  width: fit-content;
}
.my-grid .row {
    flex-wrap: nowrap;
    width: 2000px;
}
.my-grid .row div {
    flex-wrap: nowrap;
    max-width: 10%;
}
.my-grid .row div:last-child {
    max-width: fit-content;
}```
17. <@U03DA6HLSCA> the above solution worked fine I have suggested the same to customer if that didn't worked will suggest the latest CSS Style provided by you for the same.
18. Sure do let me know.

# Question: 68
Hey team,

I am working with a customer that wants to do the following:
• extract data out of a document
• use the extracted data to identify a user in their systems
• if they have any issues uniquely identifying the user, ask for human intervention
• once the user identified, fetch some user properties from their systems display them side-by-side with the extracted data, allowing a human to do the correct matching
And all the above should be done in one single action/task :smile:

Now, this is not possible using Document Validation Actions or Form Tasks, but can we do it using Apps Tasks?
Can any of you provide some guidance please?

Thank you!
** Probable Answers: **
1. cc. <@U02HS144CMB>, <@U051KD0FHRU>
2. Note (Mayo implementation) - <@U01TA9WMT0E>, <@WLRCUUUTT> - another example of needing real-time validations (and lookups) in DU Action Center ... is this the right channel to understand if we can do this with the new 'Apps' integration with DU?
3. (I will let Ioana reply, as she will be driving this :slightly_smiling_face: )
4. + <@U029S7UDCKY>
5. cc: <@U05RTM5BHRA>
6. :tada: *New note created.*
7. thank you, we are working on defining exactly this :slightly_smiling_face:
8. <@WLRCUUUTT> - I think the current solution is to perform the lookups on extracted data before Action Center ... if there are issues with the lookup, the user can make changes to the field values in AC, but will have to submit the changes to 're-do' the lookups, which, if they also fail, would have to loop back to AC for more field changes and/or reject the document to deal with outside of UiPath.

Do you know if we could solve this lookup-loop using Apps?  If not, is my characterization above accurate, or is there something else we might consider?

We're looking for a near term solution as we're in something of a pilot implementation.
9. the description is accurate Todd - but currently we don't have a Validation Station flavor that can go into Apps and communicate with the Apps process execution scenario... this is exactly what <@U05RTM5BHRA> and I are working to define
10. Thanks … last thought … I don’t the Apps functionality very well. Could we correct the extraction in AC, and then have the lookup done in Apps? 
11. cc: <@U01LM7KE013>, <@U052STFA5KQ>
12. <@U051KD0FHRU> let’s find some time tomorrow potentially to chat ?

# Question: 69
Hi Team, One of our customers has asked about the impact of changing the tenant name when using Document Understanding, AI Center, and Action Center.
Could you please let us know if this will impact the use of the Action Center? I am thinking about the possible impact on Action Center URLs for example, is that a problem?
** Probable Answers: **
1. From the Action Center perspective, I do not see any impact other than URL changes.
<@W0173AXGRP1>, do you see any other impact?
2. Thank you for letting us know!
3. Nope, everything should work as we expect.
4. I understand that there is no impact other than the change of this URL. Thank you for confirming this!

1. From this video, it looks like the `Refresh On Change`  is checked for the HTML element that renders the PDF. Could you please clear the `Refresh On Change`  checkbox and see if flickering still happens?
2. Thanks <@WNX660CV9>.I am having customer validate.

# Question: 74
Is it possible to forward to a user who has not signed into UiPath Cloud yet but is included in an AD group and should have access as soon as they sign into UiPath Cloud? Partner is saying such users are not showing up in the list to forward to.
** Probable Answers: **
1. If not currently possible, what do you recommend as a workaround? and is there anything planned to enable this?
2. Basically, if an AD group already been granted access, is it possible to allow searching for its users within Action Center so a task can be forwarded to a user that has NOT yet signed into our cloud?
3. <@WLXPJ0E69>, the user needs to sign in first.
This has been mentioned as the known limitations <https://docs.uipath.com/action-center/automation-cloud/latest/user-guide/introduction#known-limitations|here>
4. Thanks <@WNX660CV9>.
Please help me understand this statement:
&gt; Alternatively, you can continue to assign tasks to the user's UiPath account. But then organization administrators should delay the task of discontinuing UiPath account use until the issue is resolved.
This seems to suggest it's still possible to assign tasks to users who have not yet signed in using their AD account, contrary to the the paragraph above it. And I don't know what '_delay the task of discontinuing UiPath account use'_ means.

Hello, team! I am working on an RPA implementation project, and I need to display in an Action Center Form Task 2 PDFs that should be scrolled in sync. May you, please, help me with an idea/small example of custom code? I have tried may approaches, but I was not able to find any sustainable solution yet. Thank you!!
** Probable Answers: **
1. <@W015LMKSGEA> <@U04VBF17072> can this be supported in Apps? this could also help with the DU &lt;&gt; Apps integration cc: <@WLXPT7Z1T>

<@W0173AXGRP1> mentioned forms v2 doesn't have this capability today. can this not be supported in Forms v1 as well? what would it take to implement this?
cc: <@WLXPBCD0V> <@U03QQFRBFUN>
2. PDFs can be displayed using a Document Viewer control. Both of them can be displayed.

But I am not sure scrolling in sync could or could not be achieved. Need to check with Document Viewer or HTML control owners.

cc: <@U03H7L36FA4> <@U02HTTVE2AY>
3. Document Viewer control can show both pdfs but the scrolling would be independent.
<@U03H7L36FA4> can this be achieved using custom html control?
4. <@WLXP73YKA> You can add custom code using the HTML control. However, because it's a sandboxed iframe, it will block plugins for security reasons and may not allow embeddings. If you find a custom JavaScript library that can render a PDF and is compatible with CodePen, it should also work in the HTML control. I don't have an example to show right now.

If you know the size of the pdf, you can try the below,
1. Add two Document Viewer controls to a page, arranged side by side. Set the height of these controls to the maximum height of the PDF. 
2. In another page, add a page container control with a fixed height(for example, 200px) and load the previous page into it. Now the page container should allow scrolling. As you scroll in the container, both PDFs should move as well.
<@U02HTTVE2AY> I hope this approach will work if they know the height.
5. Thank you, everyone, for your help!

Hi Team, Can someone tell me what is needed to have the "preferences" tab show in Action Center admin settings?

# Question: 81
Hi Team, I have a customer who asked if they can use Action Center without Document Understanding.  They have their own digitization/OCR/extraction model but do want to leverage Action Center/Apps for human in the loop review of model outputs.  Please let me know if you have any answers and/or refer me to any contacts or resources.  Thanks in advance for your time and attention.
** Probable Answers: **
1. Yes they can.

Moreover, they can even use Validation Station witout using ocr/classification/extraction from UiPath. They will only need to provide the right data to the create validation task activities (and the "right" data is documented and can be worked with using the UiPath.DocumentProcessing.Contracts package, which defines how a DOM, an ExtractionResult, a ClassificationResult etc should look like.
2. It does require some knowledge though to build those objects, but they can do it.
3. they can do it a bit easier if they just build their own ocr engine / classifier / extractor, as each of these works with a more limited input/output mapping necessary
4. this way they can use DU as a "framework" but fill it in with their own stuff.
5. thank you <@WLRCUUUTT> for your response.  I tried to look up more info on UiPath.DocumentProcessing.Contracts but I found only limited info here: <https://docs.uipath.com/activities/other/latest/document-understanding/about-the-document-processing-contracts-pack>.  Can you refer me to any links and/or doc portal about this package so I can share back with my customer?
6. Try to have a look at this: <https://github.com/UiPath/Document-Processing-Code-Samples> . You should be able to download the code and it should build in Visual Studio. You will have a sample classifier, a sample extractor and a sample OCR engine implemented there.  Make sure to update the UiPath.DocumentProcessing.Contracts package to the latest version.

3. Thank you Niki. I need to have the ExtractionResults object as in this task. You can either obtain it by looking at the action data and grabbing the storage bucket information for the extraction results entry and then downloading it from the storage bucket, or you can run a workflow that generates these, and before you create the actioncenter task do an Assign: strExtractionResults := autoExtractionResults.Serialize(); strDOM := dom.Serialize(); strTaxonomy := taxonomy.Serialize() . Ideally I'd like to get extraction results, dom, text, original file and taxonomy.

A lot of the customers expect the functionality to be alike queues, as they don't want to wait (their unattended robot needs to keep working on other tasks or processes)

&gt; 2. How should we properly work with the Action Center? Currently, we have a situation where we have a process that retrieves information from a queue with documents of low confidence level. Unfortunately, this results in the task appearing in the action center, but the process is in suspended status and waits for the action of a user who will validate the fields. Is there a possibility to add tasks to the action center without the suspended status? We would like to add tasks continuously without blocking the running process and work on several tasks.

** Probable Answers: **
1. i assume the process reads multiple items from the queue, and when the first one is sent to action center the whole thing is suspended.

if you would have a similar approach as the du process, the outcome would be the one they expect:

• process must be modified to process one single queue item, not a bulk
• the queue will have a queue trigger set to start the process each time a new item is added to the queue.
• when a new item is added to the queue, the trigger will start a job of the process for this queue item. when the action center part is reached, the job is suspended, but this doesn't affect the other queue items/jobs

2. Hi Nicolae,
I think that makes sense, however RPA developers are used to building batch.

Not only does it complicate the build step  (Doesnt fit into RE framework)
but it also makes it very hard to orchestrate if we say 1:1.

For this customer this means 10000 process runs a month - which not only clutters orchestrator, but also ensures lowers robot output. Having theoreticalyl 10000 suspended processes really messed up every kind of insights.

If we instead could have tasks like queues, customers could choose what they want to do with them, and how they want to process them - One by one or many at a time
3. ok, i get it now. reframework and long running activities is by default not a match done in heaven. i don't know if we have a solution for this problem in the current product :confused:
4. Agreed!
and good observation with the two not fully matching. Thanks a lot for listening to the feedback!

With my knowledge in the market i would say 90% of processes that the customer wants to do Human in the loop for, would be processes that originate from a batch job of some sorts.
ALL customers have many RPA processes that fails at times. Whether its because of missing data or an obscure business rule they haven't programmed in the bot. So having a task for these is magic to them!

in regards to long running - We simply don't see many customers doing a "one-of" process requiring HITL. As there is by nature a much smaller volume.
5. Do we have some kind of example framework that can mass process?

cc <@WLRCUUUTT>
6. I guess you could:
• batch process items UP TO TASK CREATION
    ◦ put action object in a queue
• have a process pick up queue and do wait for validation (many suspended processes indeed, but robot would be freed once a suspension happens and would be woken up once the task is completed) - would need to be built so that it can pick up queue items that have not been started while many will be already in processing - if possible
    ◦ put validated results in a queue
• have a process pick up the validated results and do whatever it needs to with them. 
This would work okay for "simple" use cases in which one file = one extraction = one validation = one something afterwards, and would NOT work if a the entire process actually needs to work with N files or if a file contains N documents that need to be processed in tandem. In this case, it would be
• pick up item (n files or 1 file with n documents inside)
• process all of them for digitization, classification and automatic data extraction 
• create n human tasks
• parallel for each wait for n human tasks (a bit of variable management magic needed here)
• do post processing on all n results.
7. Hi Ioana, Yes i agree that it is possible, but customers are really not eager to have suspended processes, and "self starting" processes, as this ruins their scheduling.

Had a good discussion with <@WNX660CV9>

You proposed the idea of using Get Form Tasks and setting up a filter on completed tasks and with a set deadline. This will solve many of the issues customers have with pausing and waiting for tasks to be completed along with batch processing of transactions.
As of now the approach is quite programmatic, and it would drastically help if customers could easier set up the filters, without writing almost API like requests. So having a little more user friendly Get Form Tasks with a selector for status or date etc, will definitely help a lot.

Additionally it would be greatly beneficial if we can somehow mark the processed tasks, with either a task status/progress (similar to queues, where transactions have both status and progress, and progress can be customized). This would allow customers to easier understand what tasks have already been handled by a robot after task completion by humans.


:page_with_curl: *DU RELEVANT INFO*
Lastly, there is a requirement for having the same functionality for *Documents and therefore validation tasks.* Being able to extract these when needed and processing them "every monday" or similar will  make the flows a lot easier for customers to understand and start with.  The DU team can probably find some inspiration from the existing "get form tasks", however with the added functionality of setting filters easier, and potentially flagging them as "robot processed".

# Question: 86
Hi team,
I have a similar question to two threads above.

I created a Form in Studio and wanted to display this form in Action Center. Isn't that possible at the moment? Do I have to re-create the Form within the Form Designer of the "Create Task Form Activity"?
Will this be possible in future?

Thanks a lot for your input,
Robert
** Probable Answers: **
1. <@WLZK3F4KZ>, could you please provide the thread that you are referring to?
2. <https://uipath-customer-ops.slack.com/archives/CN71E6AG1/p1708667278413789>

I have the feeling that this is somehow similar
3. Could you please elaborate more on the issue?  You should be able to create both  - a form task from the Create Form Task activity and an app task from the Create App Task activity.
4. I created a .uiform entity in Studio. Can I use this form to display in action center? I did not find any activity for that
5. Create Form Task needs to create the form design separately. The form designer in the Create Form Task supports exporting/importing form template in the json format, but not the uiform files.
Ccing <@U02L25A27RD> in case he is aware of any way to import .uiform in the Create Form Task activity's Form Designer
6. Is it planned that the Create Form Task activity will also support the .uiform files in future? I do not see a reason why we have two different form designers within Studio
7. I am not aware if we support .uiform export/import. <@WLXPBCD0V> Do we have any plan for supporting '.uiform' in future?

# Question: 88
Hi team, congrats on the Apps + Action Center release, very exciting feature! I would like to ask if this means we are heading toward Apps being the default for Action Center actions long-term or if we still plan to support and develop <http://Forms.io|Forms.io> in parallel? And if we plan on developing both, why would a customer pick one over the other :slightly_smiling_face:
** Probable Answers: **
1. cc: <@U03E3EYC7QD>
2. we will support <http://Forms.io|Forms.io>, but to make improvements to forms have been challenging so far given its an external integration. we'll fix blockers, but improvements will be deprioritized
for the value-adds from Apps
• Trigger webservice calls for look ups (dynamic fetch)
• Performance improvements (faster load time)
• Faster build-time experience
• Task look and feel improvements, and customer-centric customization

# Question: 89
Hi team,
We have a customer who is looking to build an action center in an on-premises environment.
When comparing, there are differences with Orchestrator, but do these need to be installed?
Action Center is assumed to be installed on the same server as Orchestrator.

*[Role]*
• ASP
• <http://ASP.NET|ASP.NET> 3.5
• CGI
• Server-Side Includes
*[UiPath Guides]*
Action Center
<https://docs.uipath.com/action-center/standalone/2022.4/user-guide/prerequisites-for-installation>
Orchestrator (Installed roles and features with PowerShell)
<https://docs.uipath.com/orchestrator/standalone/2022.4/installation-guide/orchestrator-prerequisites-for-installation>

Also, if I no longer use Action Center, can I delete these roles?
** Probable Answers: **
1. <@WMLCGBZJM> any feature or role, that is ONLY required for AC can be deleted/removed in case AC is not being used on that server.
Please let me know if you have any further queries
2. <@WNX660CV9> Thank you for your comment.
The official guide states.
```Minimum required version: 8. this is part of the Web Server (IIS) role and is automatically enabled by the provided InstallRolesAndFeatures.ps1script, which can be found in here. which can be found in here.```
<https://docs.uipath.com/action-center/standalone/2022.4/user-guide/prerequisites-for-installation#action-center-server>

Using this script does not fulfil the features in the Windows Features Requirements screenshot on the same page, do I need to manually enable the roles that are missing below?

• ASP
• <http://ASP.NET|ASP.NET> 3.5
• CGI
• Server-Side Includes
In my test environment, it seems to be working without this feature at the moment, but is it necessary depending on the Form used?

# Question: 90
:large_blue_circle: Hello! Our client Paddy Power Betfair is using Action Center in UiPath Cloud.
The scenario they are having:
1. user opens the "pending" queue
2. user clicks item and assigns
3. user completes the form and submits
After the item is submitted, they want the next pending item to be displayed, in order to be later assigned. Is there any option to achieve this?
Thanks!
** Probable Answers: **
1. Hello <@WLXPATSLD>, by "pending" queue, you mean the "Unassigned" tab, right?
"Pending" tab is where a user sees the tasks assigned to him/her. After completing the task, the user stay in the "Pending" tab itself to act upon the next task.
Right now, AC does not move from "Pending" tab to "Unassigned" tab after completing the task

# Question: 92
Hi All, are there any recommendations based on the below issue?
We are facing an issue with validations in Action center forms. When task is created, submit button is not enabled, due to some invalid or missing data in some fields/tables, which is expected, but the form is not showing the error messages so the user can go ahead and correct/fill the invalid fields, they need to go one by one and validate the data manually and once corrected, the submit button is enabled. It would be great that error messages come from the beginning so the user can go ahead and correct only what is required. Another issue that we are facing is that sometimes when we load a value in the dropdown, is taking it as invalid, even though the value is part of the options in the dropdown, so the user needs to re-select that same value so the form will take it as valid.
** Probable Answers: **
1. Thank you, could you please log a jira issue with the artefacte from one such task, to better identify what we could improve (all files in the storage bucket for that task please).

2. hey Manas. They don't want to have the data returned to the server/robot once completing the validation in Action Center via the iframe. They would like to use JavaScript to access the local browser storage to "consume" the data that was validated in Action Center. They are fine hitting the Submit button if that allows data to be captured for retraining.

I know this is unusual, but I wasn't sure if we can hijack the click event on Submit to accomplish the task of storing the data locally once validated.

# Question: 98
Hi Team, Is there a tool to assign like over 100 action items to a group of users? Client is worried that they would have over 500 action items a day, and that a person choosing these and distributing them would be a bunch of work. In my mind I kind of envision a two panel attended bot that has the tasks (With a select all button) and the users on the right (with multi selection) that would just round robin the tasks to the selected users.
** Probable Answers: **
1. hi <@WLZJY3JR5>, assignment need not be manual. have you explored using Assign task from the workflow itself? you can build some logic around a group of users to be assigned round robin.

Today I worked with a customer that needed to perform those 2 changes, we did all the steps below but in the end since nothing worked. We ended up reinstalling and that did the trick.

• Confirm URL is updated in SQL database:
    ◦ [identity].[ClientRedirectUris]
    ◦ [identity].[ClientPostLogoutRedirectUris]
• Ensure that the UiPath.Orchestrator.dll.config (located in the Orchestrator installation folder) contains the following key: &lt;add key="AcceptedRootUrls" value="http://{your-localhost_name}:{port_number},https://{Action_Center_host}:{port_number}" /&gt;
• Confirm that the OPTIONS verb is allowed in IIS for the Orchestrator website.
• Modify accordingly the registry: HKLM -&gt; Software -&gt; WOW6432Node -&gt; UiPath -&gt; UiPath Action Center -&gt; Action_Center_URL
• Check the config files and configure the new URL: <https://docs.uipath.com/action-center/automation-suite/2022.10/user-guide/troubleshooting#upgrade-successful%2C-cannot-access-action-center|Action Center - Troubleshooting (><http://uipath.com|uipath.com><https://docs.uipath.com/action-center/automation-suite/2022.10/user-guide/troubleshooting#upgrade-successful%2C-cannot-access-action-center|)>

    ◦ For Processes facet, go to Action Center Folder -&gt; Processes -&gt; environments folder -&gt; env.json
• Confirmed that the certificate is correctly configured in IIS &gt; Sites &gt; UiPath Action Center &gt; Bindings.
• Did IISRESET. Issue persisted. You can browse to Action Center, but it tells that you don’t have permissions even when using the admin account.

# Question: 108
Hi team, a Health insurance customer is concerned about using Cloud Action center for their data that is processed via Cloud DU and sent to Action center for validation. What they want to know is
1. What is it that's transferred to Action center? Is it the actual document or is it just an image and/or DOM that's rendered in AC which is an output from DU?
2. While the Action center item is in pending state, meaning not actioned yet for a long period, lets say hours or days, is the image(assuming it's an image and not the actual document)  physically stored somewhere while waiting and where exactly is that? Is it in Orchestrator or back in a designated storage bucket? (customer is using their own AWS S3 bucket while using our Automation cloud Action center)
I hope that all makes sense
Thanks
** Probable Answers: **
1. 1. AC stores only the basic metadata about the DU task like title, priority, status etc. It does not store either image or actual document.
2. When a DU task is rendered in AC, the document is requested on the fly and rendered in AC.  <@WLXNV2TLY> can comment whether the document is stored in OR bucket or user managed storage bucket.
2. yes, all the data (documents, dom, extraction result, etc) are stored in Orchestrator in Storage Buckets. And this data is requested on the fly, when the action is opened, from the Orchestrator and only displayed in Action Center. Action Center doesn't store anything on their side, except for some metadata related to that task, as Manas confirmed above.
3. Thanks to you both for the answers <@WNX660CV9>, <@WLXNV2TLY>. It is very valuable to know this level of detail because customers are becoming much more aware and demanding in knowing the actual stages in data manipulation and the locations where these happen because of privacy and security and they can plan and make decisions accordingly. :100::thankyou3:

# Question: 109
I got the action center embed in another application to work, but I want to know if we can hide the navigation on the left-hand panel. It allows users to navigate to the cloud portal and they get a nasty message when they do. What about the top navigation?
** Probable Answers: **
1. Cc: <@W0173AXGRP1>
2. Hi <@U020GPLUABU> please clearly elaborate which left panel are we discussing about ?
3. I was able to find something in confluence to hide the automation cloud navigation. But that wasn't in our public docs. Is there a way to get public documentation updated so all of the URL options are available?
4. What is that solution?
5. See the Architecture section on this page

Hi Team,
From the following thread, I understand that ACenter and OC must be together either on-premises or in the cloud.
<https://uipath-japan.slack.com/archives/CN71E6AG1/p1698200918597269?thread_ts=1698084786.065179&amp;cid=CN71E6AG1>
Is this understanding correct? I ask this because, while checking the installation procedure for an on-premises environment, I noticed that an example of a parameter to specify in the installer included a cloud URL, so I want to confirm just to be sure. There is no immediate impact, so there's no need for a prompt modification of the installer.
** Probable Answers: **
1. Yes, AC and OR both must be either on-prem or cloud. AC does not support hybrid approach right now.

# Question: 112
Hi team,
Richemont is planning to start using Action Center after their migration to Automation Cloud.
As found from this previous discussion <https://uipath-customer-ops.slack.com/archives/CN71E6AG1/p1664284543825769|here>, it seems that there's no way to allocate Action Center licenses to users.
So Richemont would like to know how is calculated the consumption of Action Center licenses.
Is it something simple like the number of distinct users having completed actions during each month?
Is it the number of users having access to Action Center service (based on the Catalogs they have access through Modern folders)?
Thanks!

# Question: 114
Hi team,
I have a client trying to highlight some text when an event occurs on their form. They didn't achieve to have it working. They tried different ways:
• Using "Property" action type 
• Using "Merge component schema" action type
```schema={
 "attributes": {
 "style": "background-color: blue; color: white;"
 }
 }```
• Using Javascript custom action type
Do we have some samples of these types of customizations somewhere? Is there someone who could help us on this?
Thanks!
** Probable Answers: **
1. <@W0173AXGRP1> - please take a look at it
2. The CSS Customisations doesn't seem to work as expected. This is a bug with our Third Party Dependency and we will have to raise it with them.

cc <@WLXPBCD0V> <@U03E3EYC7QD>
3. Thanks <@W0173AXGRP1>! By the way, what is the right way to do CSS customizations for forms in Action Center? (I mean when the bug will be fixed)
4. The simplest way would be via Property. You would be able to add CSS classes if you want to use the pre defined css.
5. Do we have some documentation about the available CSS classes and how to add them?
Did you create a bug on our Jira to follow the issue? My client, Oerlikon, would like to be kept informed when it will be fixed.
Thanks!
6. <https://uipath.atlassian.net/browse/ACTN-5399>
&gt; This is a bug with our Third Party Dependency
Once we get a response from them, we will revert back.
7. Please refer to this sample file CSS.xaml, when you set the value as 1 in the first field the css is getting applied.
To do this I edited the JSON schema of the field where the css needs to be applied.
and changed the "value" field's value from `className` to `customClass`
```"property": {
            "label": "CSS Class",
            "value": "customClass",
            "type": "string"

# Question: 122
Hello team,

AON has an urgent ask to restrict formatting of the data that user input for a task or validation station before they submit the task so they can guarantee data quality coming through from users. Currently we have Business rule under Taxonomy manager that highlights the fields when it doesn't fit the formats provided. However, the fields takes anything from user. if the field is a datetime type, it still accepts string such as "open for 15 days" into the datetime type field.

Can we please add this into the roadmap or if we have this in a roadmap already, can we put it as higher priority?

Have you seen this behavior before?

The value that you set in Studio is in UTC values and when it is displayed/redered in Action Center it would show up in Local Timezone.

Unfortunately the options to let user control this behaviour is not available. We're taking this issue with our third party dependency <http://Form.io|Form.io> and a fix from them will take a lot of time until that I would suggest that we use back calculate the values and set the UTC values (in Studio) of the actual values to be displayed in Action Center.

# Question: 126
Hello, we have a customer who has questions about how Action Center assigns action items:
1. _Why is AC designed to first assign actions rather than automatically locking/releasing items as they are opened/closed by any user?_
2. _Is a feature like this being considered?_
I want to tell them that assigning/unassigning is the motion of opening/closing, but it appears they want something more streamlined and passive. I'd also imagine the current design is due in part to potential issues like accidental locking and how to define "opened", but would appreciate this team's perspective on how to respond. Thanks!

CC: <@U01KLBEUR6J>
** Probable Answers: **
1. Hello, any input or guidance on a helpful response to the customer would be much appreciated. Thanks!
2. hey Timothy, i'm not aware of the exact historical reasons but i believe
• assignment better avoids race conditions - multiple users could have the same task open, but with assignment multiple users cannot have the same task assigned to them.
• looking at competing platform implementations as well as from customer asks, explicit assign/claim for tasks has been a requirement
• we do not have a plan to reconsider this in the short term roadmap

Hi Team! Do you currently have a customer that is leveraging Action Center as a way to manage exceptions. Is this possible and how would this work?
If this is not possible what recommendations would we offer the customer?

My initial thought is this will not work and my recommendation would be to track reworks:
1. Apps
2. Insights reporting
3. Notifications i.e. email, teams, etc
Thanks in advance (edited)
** Probable Answers: **
1. Hi Chris,
IMO, it depends on type of exception: Business or System/Application/etc.  My customer and I have met multiple times to talk about architecting ideas for them to handle not only business verification tasks but also as a method of correcting some of their simpler application exceptions to quickly correct and resubmit for processing (using the forms activities vs Apps).   I am not sure if they've implemented it but don't see why not.  We've only confirmed they use Action Center for DU or for business rule verifications.

In most of thier smaller automation teams, they use Notifications via email and output exceptions to a spreadsheet for manual correction - This was an older method and they may have rearchitected by now... but... they usually function on an "If it ain't broke..." decision method :sweat_smile:
2. <@WLLAWTCE6> do you have any diagrams or notes? (even in rough form) love me some synergy

<@U037AALP9CK> Were you thinking something like?
1. Exception generated (but caught by e.g. REFramework, so processing continues with next item)
2. Action Center item generated for the failed item
3. Normal AC flow where it gets assigned to a user to investigate
4. User kindly does the needful for the failed item
5. Action Center used for visibility into failed item resolution (might need some AC vs queue matching in Insights for full visibility
3. <@U033QAUEN9L> - Not on hand, we were limited to v21.10/v22.10 AC and based discussions around the HighSpot product slides and our docs to review / guide their understanding and brainstorming.  Mostly what you laid out above is the route we discussed, good synergy already! :grin:
4. it actually sounds like a really good toggleable in REFramework, as the unattended-side support should be simple (just create an AC item while you're in the exception handler)
5. <@U033QAUEN9L>, That is exactly what the customer was thinking. Would someone be able to send information from the queue item found in Specific Data to AC and what would the action center item look like?
6. I tried creating an action and nothing is displayed in the action. It doesnt seem to work OOTB.
7. That's interesting, which version are you working with? AC?
8. <@U037AALP9CK> can you email me your test project? I can take a look
9. <@U033QAUEN9L> It's a simple process
10. <@U037AALP9CK> Have you looked at the Orchestration Process template? That seems to be the workflow to use. I can't find a User Guide for the template anywhere though.
11. I can take a look at that but I'm not sure if it does the same since it looks like the process will essentially wait for the action item to be completed. I believe it's going to be more about fire and forget. Meaning they would create an action item if it's a BE or the last retry of an SE. Then they would use the action item complete the work manually.
12. <@U033QAUEN9L>, Did you get a chance to review the solution? Did I do something wrong?
13. FYI... Ethan and I tied off and we found that I am using the wrong type of task to create a form. External &gt; Form.

# Question: 140
Hi Team,

One of our customer is trying to submit the task using the API ("forms/TaskForms/CompleteTask") and its returning the response "This action is no longer assigned to you".

I have tried replicating the issue at my end and observed that when the task is assigned to User A (<mailto:Vishnu.Kothamasu@uipath.com|Vishnu.Kothamasu@uipath.com>) and able to submit the task.
When i assigned the task to User B (<mailto:balamanikanta.krishnam@uipath.com|balamanikanta.krishnam@uipath.com>) and getting the same error as mentioned above.
Both the users have administrator roles we also provided the Org admin role to the User B but no luck.
From the analysis my findings were the only difference between the User A and User B is User A is a local user and User B is a Directory User.
But however I have one more User with account type as Local User so we tried assigning to that User C but still its giving the same error.

Need your help in understanding why we are unable to submit the actions using API.

Thanks in advance.

# Question: 141
Hello team. I have a case where cx wants to change OnPrem Action Center URL post install. Is it recommended to reinstall it or we can just go and update the URL in the following places:
• ActionCenter/*Actions*/environments/env.json
• ActionCenter/*Processes*/environments/env.json
• SQL tables --&gt; identity.ClientRedirectUris --- identity.ClientPostLogoutRedirectUris
• Regedit Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\UiPath\UiPath Action Center
** Probable Answers: **
1. I had tested the manual change and it worked fine, I see no errors in event viewer and can access the site without issues.
• Could this cause any kind of issue in the future?

# Question: 142
Hi team, Is there any way to change TCP port after installing On-Premise Action Center?
My client knew the port can not use after install..
** Probable Answers: **
1. It is not possible to change TCP port after installation as installation step register AC details (URL and port number) to the identity service.
However, you can uninstall and reinstall the AC on a diff port. This step will not cause any data loss

# Question: 143
Hi Team, can we format the text in the TextArea component?

For example, the customer wants the text to appear on a new line.

We tried adding a "&lt;br /&gt;" tag to the text and the text appears on the new line however when we assign the action to a user the user could see the "&lt;br /&gt;" tags as well.

The customer does not want the show the "&lt;br /&gt;" tag to the end user as they are business users.

Please let me know if the above is feasible and if not then any alternatives to achieve the same.
** Probable Answers: **
1. You can try using `\r\n`  in place of `&lt;br&gt;`  tag. Below is the example of new line in unassigned and pending task:
2. Hi Manas,

Thank you for looking into the issue.

I have checked the behavior at my end and was unable to make it work.

Attaching a sample workflow for reference. In the workflow I am assign a text value and adding the "\r\n" in the "sampleTextArea" variable. I am passing the same variable as an input to the Form.

Do let me know if I am missing something.
3. As you are using VB, we have couple of workarounds:
1. use VbCrlf
2. use Environment.NewLine

4. Hi <@WNX660CV9>, Thank you for the suggestions.

However, the customer checked the behaviour at their end and found a different behaviour with the Edit Grid component and DataGrid component.

The above suggested workarounds seem to work in DataGrid but it does not work in Edit Grid.

Kindly let us know if there is some way that works in the EditGrid component.
5. I will check it tomorrow 
6. Hi <@WNX660CV9>, Do we have any update?
7. Hi <@WNX660CV9>
Can you please check this today, the case has been pending for a while. thanks
8. Today <@WLZJP9J15> and I looked into the editgrid scenarios. None of the above solutions worked for editgrid read-only mode. However, in edit mode, we can see the new lines.
<@WLZJP9J15>, I would suggest to use css for making newlines work in read-only mode. You can try using
`white-space: pre-line` for this use case - <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/white-space>

# Question: 144
HI, Team.
My customer has a problem.
Using the DigitizeDocument activity, he converts a PDF file into a Document Model. Content is in Japanese. The OCR engine is CJK. The identification results are posted to the Action Center using the CreateDocumentValidationAction activity. The issue lies in the Action Center where not all the strings are being displayed. During debugging, the text in the PDF is correctly identified. Please provide a workaround for this problem.
Action Center: Standalone 21.10.4
Brower: Chrome
** Probable Answers: **
1. please post in <#CQ7R1EQL8|help-documentunderstanding>
2. does the ExtractionResults object that you feed into the Validation Station task creation activity contain those strings?
3. <@WLRCUUUTT> Yes, it contained those string.  And I tried this project in my Automation Cloud. All of the strings could be displayed in Action Center.
4. Hello <@U02QPDVRUBZ>, I don't think I understand - this is what gets extracted in the test project and how it looks in Validaiton Station - what else should be there? <https://zoom.us/clips/share/5rkmc9RL1QfY_hB-idIwSQAyizSPlO4-y04mFGxF6DSxf4xvH06HIAPggjKt2sJ6t7amqO4kw7iU7oXVkdFj0rFg.RRMqmKZdmDTTjPRV>
5. BTW, I did need to install some font - Adobe, when I first opened the PDF, asked me to install missing fonts, and I clicked ok.
6. Can you please try to open the file on your computer using Adobe Reader and see if you can see it correctly? If it does ask you to install something, maybe try to see if it gives you ifnormation about what it is trying to install?
7. And after you install it, see if you can see the task correctly? I don't yet know where the issue comes from, trying to identify if the font isntallation actually solved the issue on my machine only (which I don't want to backup and send to production :))))) )
8. Hi <@WLRCUUUTT>
I took over this issue from <@U02QPDVRUBZ> since he is now on a leave. Just tested out reading the attached PDF, then found there was no pop-up to install font when opening the file with Adobe Reader. Also the letters on PDF are able to shown as expected.
Will test to see if I am able to see the letters on On-Prem Action Center.
9. hi <@WLRCUUUTT> I have reproduced on 21.10 Action Center.
I found that the fonts of PDF file is [KozMinPr6N-Regular].
Then I converted this file to a new pdf file by using Print as PDF.
All of the words could be displayed.
So I guess it is a problem of <http://fonts.Is|fonts.Is> it a bug of 21.10?

According to the following guide, update to 22.10 maybe can resolved this problem. Is there any other solution with 21.10 Action Center?
<https://docs.uipath.com/action-center/standalone/2022.10/user-guide/release-notes-2022-10-0#bug-fixes>
10. as far as I can see, the issue is fixed in 22.4 on-prem, latest... and of course in 22.10.

There is no workaround that the customer can do at this moment, to my knowledge...

Is it very complicated for the customer to upgrade to a newer version?
11. &gt; as far as I can see, the issue is fixed in 22.4 on-prem, latest... and of course in 22.10.
Thank you!
&gt; Is it very complicated for the customer to upgrade to a newer version?
I have no idea about this. I will suggest the customer to upgrade to a newer version.
By the way, do you know that do we have a jira for this?
12. before you recommend an upgrade, any chance you can test with a 22.4 latest or a 22.10? I don't have one at hand to test with this particular doucment
13. I have a jira ticket with the fix, about a year ago
14. is that what you need?

Hi Team, a customer (Navia Benefits Solutions) had an issue regarding the Date/Time component in Forms.

*Description*:
• The customer wants to show a pre-defined date in the form.
• They are passing a variable of type DateTime as an input to form.
• For User-1 in the IST timezone while viewing the action in Action Center correct time is displayed. For example: `20-12-2023` [dd-mm-yy]
• For User-2 in PST timezone while viewing the action in Action Center incorrect time is displayed. For example: `19-12-2023` [dd-mm-yy]
*Steps Performed*:
1. We have tried changing the "displayInTimezone" property from "viewer" to  "location" and setting the "timezone" property to "PST8PDT" but still the issue persists.
2. Similarly, we have tried changing the "displayInTimezone" property from "viewer" to  "submission" but still the issue persists.
Is there any way to show the same date across all timezones? Thank you :thanks-bowing-man:

Hello Team,

*Issue*: The AD group is added inside the Local group. After this, the users inside the AD group are not getting permissions (say task assignment permission)

*Details*:

• AD users were directly added and it's working.
• Adding the AD *group* inside the Local group for easy management is not working. (The local group is working fine as expected)
• Cloud Orchestrator | 4610-8862-4321-3743
*Findings*:

• Logged in to Orchestrator API as the *specific AD user.* Could assign the task via API
• Logged in to Orchestrator API as the *Robot user*. Could assign the task via API
• Even though the task assignment is successful for AD users via API, it's not working normally.

# Question: 151
Hello team, is there a release calendar available for Cloud? my customer Cigna would like to understand when the next deployment to GxP is going to be (after the freeze) and what's included that could potentially impact them, they will be entering a critical period from Jan 1st -19th and they would like to be prepared, thank you!
** Probable Answers: **
1. Hello <@W01958JV1QE> the next deployment on cloud post freeze for Action Center is first week of Jan. May be 03/Jan on GXP. We can be a little flexible here in case if the deployment should be pushed out to the week of 08/Jan, which might be the case in case the team's support is thin following the holidays
2. I have most of the teams aligned to 19th or 25th, Data Service, Insights, Apps, would it be possible?
3. Let me review this with the team and get back
4. <@W01958JV1QE> we had a discussion on this. Jan 19th or 25th seems to be a concern for us considering the amount of sprint payload that will be out of sync from our enterprise rings.

Tagging <@WLXNYUESC> and <@WLXPBCD0V> here for discussion, to understand the concern Cigna may have.
5. They get into a critical period from Jan 1st to the 19th due to open enrollment, and they currently have 15k attended users which could be impacted is something breaks, they have shared that all the incidents would be submitted as critical during that period due to the criticality, we could also share what is going to be deployed on Jan 3 ahead of time so they can test, however if they encounter an issue they would submit it as critical, they had a call with our leadership to share the same and ask for collaboration where possible
6. <@WLXPBCD0V> is this something we can support?
CC: <@WLXNYUESC>
7. This is their requirement

Stability Period:  12/11/23 6:00AM ET - 1/11/24 11:59 PM ET
Ramp-up Period: 1/12/24 - 1/19/24 (~50% of normal change volumes will be approved)
Business as Usual: 01/20/24 onwards

even after 1/11 could help but preferably after or on the 19th if possible
8. <@WLXPBCD0V> can you please review and advise?
9. Hi <@W01958JV1QE> - we are currently in deployment freeze which will last from today till  1/3 (3rd Jan). As I understand, the ask is for extending the freeze till 1/19. This should be mostly  possible. I will come back here and confirm by today.
10. <@W01958JV1QE> We discussed this internally and we think we can defer the GXP deployment for Action Center to 22/Jan. I hope this works. Please confirm, so that we can schedule accordingly.

# Question: 154
hi all,

I have a customer with multiple forms/actions in Action Center with required fields. Should any of the said fields not get filled out, a mandatory field green button representing the form FieldKey will grey out. From here, the customer wants to be able to Edit Bulk Actions and click a Submit button which should then either refuse to submit and display an error listing the forms with required fields still empty else just gray out as well.

My thought is this might be possible via conditions on components else Javascript:

<https://docs.uipath.com/activities/other/latest/workflow/conditional-components>

But am unfamiliar on how FieldKeys are passed between forms else the syntax needed to make this happen. <@W0173AXGRP1> and <@WLXNYUESC>, the customer mentioned they had worked with you over the space of a month on this and other action center related issues. In the feedback you had provided them "Bulk form field key would refer to form field collection values that were mapped to field key in a normal form., that's the link between them.", how do we establish said mentioned link? Thoughts welcome.
** Probable Answers: **
1. We are about to release Apps in Action Center. You should use Apps and it can easily do all these checks.  <@W0173AXGRP1> <@WLXNYUESC> any reason why we are not suggesting that?
2. Hello <@U05GAQZRBUZ>,
Apps Action Center is not yet in preview or available for enterprise consumption and does not have all the features that customers are looking at. Specifically bulk edit/complete that this customer is trying to implement.
We need to protect existing customer base who are in various stages of their project using forms as the only available custom visualization option and we have not called out Task forms as out of support. We need to do it gradually after we first release Apps as a user interface, bridge the product gaps. Until then, we will need to engage/support customers who are using forms.
3. Hi <@WLX9BQS2G>, I have replied to <@U055QCLSS8M> in The DM. The Submit button in Bulk form needs to be disabled in order to prevent user from submitting in Bulk Edit mode. User will save the bulk edit data and take the action on individual tasks.
4. <@W0173AXGRP1> ok. How does the user save the bulk edit data? So they just click the save button on each form and then add a submit button to each form as well?
5. To save the bulk edited fields,user should add the data into the fields, and click on the save button (save icon) in the header bar.
To submit the form, open each form individually, user will find the bulk edited data pre filled, user can fill all the other required fields and then submit the form.
6. <@W0173AXGRP1> Customer responded today: "Sharon shard this with me as well but it doesn’t create the best user experience. Implementing this would require them to individually submit each action item which creates more work for them. Is there a way to bulk submit from the regular non bulk form screen?"
7. Hello Vincent,
Two ways to use bulk complete / bulk edit form.
1. Update same information in multiple forms at a go without completing the form, example tax code to be updated the same in 500 tasks. Update this field, save it and users can review tasks individually and submit. In this case, it is ideal to disable submit/complete task button that would drive users to use 'save' icon in the header.
2. Update set of fields and complete tasks in bulk. In this case, bulk form should contain all the bare minimum fields required for task completion including all the validations as required.  Runtime validations are not done across bulk form ,comparing with original form for every bulk completed task at present as it will be highly performance intensive. I believe RPA devs can make the experience better by designing bulk form with all the validations required to complete a task (bring all mandatory fields on to bulk form?
Bulk submit requires bulk form as it is an explicit decision to allow bulk completion (and bulk editable fields). We will take this feedback as an improvement in our backlog  .
8. <@WLXNYUESC> <@W0173AXGRP1> Customer came back with the following:

"Neither of these options are good user experiences for our users. Are there any other options that you would suggest?

Is this bulk complete/check required form fields improvement something that you are able to prioritize in the backlog?"

What would be the recommended next steps at this point? Should I go ahead and create a feature request and TIF?

# Question: 156
Hi team, hoping you can shed some light on this customer question. TLDR is, what HITL support do we provide in Action Center for _other_ IDP vendors? It wouldn't be nearly as seamless, right?
** Probable Answers: **
1. Hello Daniel,
We do not have any out of the box support for validating extracted content from other IDP vendors and our priority has been to integrate with our DU & AI Center services for providing out-of-the box HITL solution.
Having said that, our workflows can consume any IDP end points , process , extract data and we provide support for custom user interfaces for human validations with in Action Center (using forms today, with Apps in early Q1 '24),  they can build custom validation UI for non-DU cases .
As a side note, It will be interesting for our DU team to understand why customer is exploring other IDP vendors

# Question: 158
Good day,

We are busy with an AI review use case for AC.

All AC tasks are being reviewed by an AI panel if they can complete the task without referring it to humans.

Q: Is there an Update Task activity that we can use to update instead of complete the task (Current only activity).

We get the list of tasks, and if the confidence is high we complete the task, the issue with low confidence, we can't update/add info to fields and then keep it non-complete. Is there a way that we can update/edit only the task?
** Probable Answers: **
1. Persistence Activities pack only provides `Add Task Comment` and `Update Task Labels` . As a workaround, you can call `Orchestrator HTTP Request`  activity to update the task update task's metadata or task's data.

# Question: 159
Hi team, our client, EY are doing their infosec review, and have found couple of findings. Can you let me know your views pls? Thanx.

1. Form auto-complete should be disabled on fields collecting credentials, confidential information and PII.
 Auto complete allows confidential data cached. Attacker can gain unauthorized access to the confidential data if the cached storage is compromised."
It is observed that, form-auto complete is enabled on fields collecting “Catalog” information.
*Corrective Action Suggested*: Disallow auto-complete function.

2. All input (user and service) must be validated on the server side to permit only the allowed characters and limited field length necessary for the corresponding function. Without proper server side input validation, an attacker may construct input that circumvents access controls or produces a negative unexpected result. In our assessment, it is observed that the application (UiPath Action Centre) is accepting special/malicious characters in the input field. It is recommended to disallow such characters on both client-side &amp; server-side to avoid any other injection-based attacks.
** Probable Answers: **
1. Seems fair. Have you raised bugs for these?  <@WLXPBCD0V>?
2. <@U05GAQZRBUZ> Created a ticket to take care of this and the apollo library updates:

<https://uipath.atlassian.net/browse/ACTN-5112>

CC: <@WLXPBCD0V>
3. This ticket is to disable the auto complete and updating the package version. For point #2 we need to check which all fields are allowing special characters and need to consult with the product team on why was this available to begin with and if we need to have special characters here or not.

CC: <@WLXPBCD0V> <@WLXNYUESC>
4. Hi Team, any progress on point #2 pls?
5. <@WLXNYUESC> For point#2, do we need to allow special characters? If not we can check which all fields allow special characters and we can fix them accordingly.

CC: <@WLXPBCD0V>
6. Hello <@U03DA6HLSCA>,  let's discuss this further and capture our approach in this ticket <https://uipath.atlassian.net/browse/ACTN-5137>
7. Hi Team, Just checking any progress on #2 pls? Also, whats the message to be conveyed to the client?
8. Hi <@WLRD592UR>, unfortunately, we did not make good progress on this issue yet <https://uipath.atlassian.net/browse/ACTN-5137> due to competing priorities.
 <@U03E3EYC7QD> <@WLXPBCD0V> <@U03DA6HLSCA>, bumping this up to have this in our radar as we have to get back with a plan of action to EY

# Question: 160
Experts Hi, Within a DU project, I am trying to implement data check step before extraction ticket creation. For example, within a numeric field, if there is a "-" in front of the value, delete that minus sign and if ticket is created, don't show minus on the ticket. I was able to do it for singular fields. But, same implementation does not work if that field within table field. I am not sure if I am clear enough but I couldn't figure out whats the difference between regular field and table cells. Do you have any guess?

# Question: 161
Hi All,

I'm working on a use case with Admiral to try and get COE support for an AI driven use case where we are using GPT 4 to generate an action center action for us. The generated text in the text area appears in a box that resizes (since the text size will be variable) perfectly upon action creation. (See  first 2 screenshots)

As soon as we assign the action the box shrinks again and we have to resize it manually (See 3rd screenshot for post assignment) is it possible for the text Area to keep this size and us not have to resize? its cumbersome and time consuming to resize (see arrow showing the small point you need to target for the cursor, you need very high precision with the mouse cursor!) for long messages. It removes a lot of the value of using this solution. doing this
** Probable Answers: **
1. Yeah but i'm not sure if its the form activity of cloud AC
2. <@WLXNYUESC> maybe could you help us?
Or <@U01QZSVLWUT> curious if you bumped into this with your projects? Feels quite common with GenAI capabilities
3. Hmm seems like an action center rendering issue if you make the box dynamic. Could you instead have a non-size adjusting text field and keep it a fixed length to account for most email text generated? May be a better option in the short term
4. <@U01QZSVLWUT> do you mean setting a minimum word length?
5. Ignore that, it doesn't work
6. I'm not sure how to hard code the dimensions of the text area or text field, i see here we can style text with a custom css file <https://docs.uipath.com/activities/other/latest/workflow/local-css-file>, but ideally we want a way to set pixel size for that field.
7. <@WLXNYUESC> <@WLXPBCD0V> <@U044LMQ9M19> guys this is quite critical for us at EUI Limited. This is a strategic customer in the UK
8. tagging <@U03B4909B42> who is the DRI for this week. <@U03B4909B42> can you please help here
CC: <@WLXPBCD0V>
9. <@U02EVUK474L>, please share form.json or workflow with which we could quickly reproduce this at our end.
cc <@W0173AXGRP1>
10. <@U02EVUK474L> Please share me a sample workflow, which could help me reproduce this. I'll look into this and help you on this further.
11. Thanks <@U02EVUK474L> for helping me with the Workflow. We're looking at how this issue could be resolved.
12. <@W0173AXGRP1> No problem at all! If you do find a fix to the front End is it possible to propagate the change early only to the customer's Cloud Organization as a quick patch? Or are are updates only bi-monthly? <@WLXPBCD0V>
13. In general the releases are bi-monthly. We have a company wide freeze from 14th Dec, we'll try to fix this as soon as we can
14. Hey <@U02EVUK474L>, the the fix is found. Please refer to <https://uipath.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/ACTN/boards/1188?assignee=5f1829dd1a26ad00147898ac&amp;selectedIssue=ACTN-5105>
15. GTM teams don't have access to jira anymore :melting-face: what's the targeted date fix?
16. Hello <@WLXP4TP9N>, this does not require a fix in the product but can be done through a design time JSON configuration for that TextField control in the forms designer.
17. oh, amazing. <@U02EVUK474L> hoping you have access.
18. This is fixed in a call with <@U02EVUK474L>
19. Thanks a lots <@W0173AXGRP1>. This is a big help for us

# Question: 163
Hello,
Customer Veolia is asking if we can embed DU actions in Workday for operators to validate extraction. Is it possible ?
Thanks.
** Probable Answers: **
1. <https://docs.uipath.com/action-center/automation-cloud/latest/user-guide/embedding-actions>
2. Thanks <@WLXNYUESC>. I know this documentation. I just wondered if we tested Workday specifically. Or if we know about a customer who did it.
Does it work via an iframe ?
3. 1. It is embedding via iFrame and we have not tested with specific applications.
